my git steps : 

git clone https://github.ps.thmulti.com/mpc-film/houdiniAssets.git

git checkout -b contra

make changes to the assetPkgNodes.py

git status 

git add . (or manually add any files that have not been added? if there is a red file left) 

git commit -m "adding changes to the assetPkgNodes.py for USD-Groom asset fix"  (is the comment descriptive enough? )

git remote (to find out the origin ) 

git push origin contra

then create pull request on github repo (should i write down anything in the pull request? )
