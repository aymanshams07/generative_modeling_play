Repo of my work with VFX

# Project 1 : Sim2Real Project Report for Duckietown (GAN and Neural Style Transfer) 

- (https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/course-extra/out/sim2real_final_report.html)
- Simulator images were extracted after image processing is done to remove redundancy
- sim images were used to train CycleGAN and UNIT
- in an attempt to do sim2real

# Project 2 : Style transfer for Duckietown

- Static images were used transfer the style of real images to simulator images 

# Project 3 : Face Recognition

- worked on a dataset of facial images of dimension 650 X 506 X 3
- performed PCA to reduce dimentionality of the images
- calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors eventually reshaped to eigenface
- More details of the code will be produced when asked
- Google Doc


# Project 4 : ENAS for medical Image Recognition
