Repo of my work related to VFX

## Project 1 : UnPaired image-to-image translation using cycle connsistent GANs for Sim2Real task 

- Project aims to reduce reality gap by using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate realistic images from simullation images. 
- https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/course-extra/out/sim2real_final_report.html
- Simulator images were extracted after image processing is done to remove redundancy
- sim images CycleGAN and UNIT

## Project 1 part 2: Style transfer for Duckietown

- VGG-19 CNN architecture is used to extract both the content and style features from the content and style images respectively.
 
- check project report

# Project 3 : Face Recognition

- Project report : https://docs.google.com/document/d/11p0kalhKnpEl-ZTEpxwSHA3AIvaukwr7S6v5ZMj9Mbs/edit
- worked on a dataset of facial images of dimension 650 X 506 X 3
- performed PCA to reduce dimentionality of the images
- calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors eventually reshaped to eigenface
- More details of the code will be produced when asked
